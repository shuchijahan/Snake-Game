# Snake Game in Python

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `pygame` library. The game features a snake that grows longer each time it eats food, and the player must avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Snake moves around the screen, and you control it using the arrow keys.
- Each time the snake eats food (yellow block), it grows longer.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
- After losing, you can choose to play again or quit the game.

## How to Play

- **Move the snake** using the arrow keys:
  - **Up** arrow key to move up.
  - **Down** arrow key to move down.
  - **Left** arrow key to move left.
  - **Right** arrow key to move right.
- **Eat the food** (yellow block) to grow the snake and increase your score.
- **Avoid walls** and **avoid running into the snake's body**.
- **Press Q** to quit the game after losing.
- **Press C** to restart the game after losing.
